I used to have a shared hosting account for my website.

Then I decided I wanted more control. As a web developer, I had moved beyond php/MySQL, and wanted to play with Postgres, Python, and other interesting stuff, and make it available to the world. So I got myself a VPS.

I could install and run anything I wanted, and it was great.

I had multiple WordPress installs going for myself, friends, and other people who I’d offered to help out. I also had a couple Django apps running, as well as some experiments with fully static websites, and I was toying with a few NoSQL databases and apps running off those. All this stuff was great and all, but I eventually realized that all I was really using it for was pretty much the same thing I had used the shared hosting for: my blog (on WordPress), and a sort of résumé page to let the world know who I am.

In the meantime I had grown/changed/whatever/etc.

You see, when I first got the VPS, I wanted to build everything myself. If I used something that didn’t work quite the way I wanted it to, I would try to build it myself. I built all kinds of stuff that I thought was pretty cool.
And I still think those projects were pretty cool.

But there are plenty of people out there that are doing stuff that’s really cool. And they’re sharing it, for money or for other things (ad revenue, recognition, being awesome open source contributors, etc.). And in the meantime, my VPS became a mess of old projects that I rarely touched.

So I got rid of my VPS. And I’m in the process of moving my stuff elsewhere.

Here’s what I now think about this mess… I was building or modifying stuff to solve small problems, which is all very well and good as a learning experience, but it was taking time and energy away from the bigger problems that I wanted to solve, or projects I wanted to build.

That’s not to discount the value of building stuff. I think building new stuff is amongst the best things one can do for personal and professional development. The more stuff you make, the better you are at being creative (obviously), and recognizing and solving problems. And building stuff is a great opportunity to learn about cool things.

But I think I did a poor job of setting the context for these projects: instead of building on top of other stuff, I often built from scratch. Instead of working on bigger visions, I was working on minor irritations.

Now I’m moving my writing to Medium, my photos to SmugMug (that’s my referral link), and my main site (which is static) to S3.

All these services are really good at doing what they do, and have teams of people making sure they’re running properly. So instead of the mess I used to have, my domain now points to three, really well managed services, and I actually pay less per year for them than I did for the VPS.

This is also how I feel about building software these days, but I’ll write another post about that later…
