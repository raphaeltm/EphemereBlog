For a while now, I’ve been carrying a camera around on a day to day basis, in case I see anything interesting that might be worth capturing. A few of those shots make it onto my photography site, but a lot of them are more… interesting, than worth publishing. There’s a threshold between what I’d like to make available as a print on my portfolio, and what I’d like to show, but not assign too much importance.

At one point, I built a little web app called Phoglo which was supposed to be a place for precisely that kind of image, but in the end I didn’t use it much. I could have spent more time on it, to try and figure out exactly what was missing, but in the end I realized that these images felt a bit like blog content: they’re interesting in a particular moment, because I feel like showing them and writing a bit about them, not because they’re print or portfolio-worthy.

I’m going to start using this space to show and write about some of those images. I will also include a few that are actually on my photography site already.

Here’s the first set. These are going to be a few of my older shots, from when I first really started to get into photography.

## Emil and Lebo

These were our dogs when I was in high-school, when I got my first DSLR. They were lovely little dogs. They also made for excellent subjects for someone first getting more serious about photography.

## Québec

My mother is from Québec, near Montréal in the Eastern Townships. My parents have a condo in the region and we often drove around through the countryside looking for interesting photos to take. This was one of them, also from not long after I got my first DSLR.

## Purple Flower

I think every newbie photographer gets excited about flowers at some point. Of course, that excitement doesn’t have to die down. In my case, one of the things I was most excited about when I got my first DSLR was the shallow depth of field that came with the gear. That gets particularly exciting with small subjects like flowers where you have to get really close and get the very limited “DOF” that comes with the territory. This is one of those early flower shots.

Cute Elephants
I love elephants. They’re such [wonderful, amazing animals](http://savetheelephants.org/). This shot was taken in Tarangire National Park in Tanzania. It was really interesting to watch the interaction between these two. I have absolutely no idea what the significance of the gesture is, but if anybody reading this does, I’d love to hear about it. Though I guess a still shot isn’t much to go on… If you’d like to buy a print of this shot, you can [get one here](http://photography.raphaeltm.com/Wildlife/i-jt62wsZ/buy).
